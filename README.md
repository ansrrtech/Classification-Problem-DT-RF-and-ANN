# Classification-Problem-DT-RF-and-ANN
An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decides to collect data from the past few years. You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. Use CART, RF & ANN and compare the models' performances in train and test sets.

Steps:
1 Data Ingestion: Read the dataset. Do the descriptive statistics and do null value condition check, write an inference on it.
2 Data Split: Split the data into test and train, build classification model CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network
3 Performance Metrics: Check the performance of Predictions on Train and Test sets using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Plot ROC curve and get ROC_AUC score for each model
4 Final Model: Compare all the model and write an inference which model is best/optimized.
5 Inference: Basis on these predictions, what are the business insights and recommendations
